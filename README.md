# Mattermost Channel Notes Plugin

A [Mattermost](https://mattermost.com) plugin that extends channel functionality with note taking.

## About

Sometimes the channel header isn't enough for all the information you want to keep in a channel. The channel notes plugin allows for free-form markdown notes for each channel. You can tell there are notes in the channel by looking at the channel header icon.
